  <description>Sarcophagi function as tables. That is all. Safe to add/remove.

This description feels too short, so - 

Pawns will eat at a sarcophagus if there are chairs next to it, just like they do with tables. A sarcophagus can be designated as a gathering spot, like a table can.

Update: Like tables, sarcophagi can now be reinstalled.
